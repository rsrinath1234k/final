# Final Project Template

### KIEI-451 Spring 2021
This project contains the contents of the NBA MVP voting website we built. The website allows user to view the stats of the MVP candidates, their player bios, vote on the MVPs, and also see the voting results. We also built in a weather API for those who are inspired to check the weather and go play basketball after using the website.

Begin by cloning this project and running `npm install`, then replace the Firebase configuration in both `/netlify/functions/firebase.js` and `index.html` with your own Firebase configuration object.
